## What is the Analytic Hierarchy Process?

* Came across this in this InfoQ interview with the developer: [Applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process for Tech Decisions](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/11/analytic-hierarchy-process/)
* It is a structured technique to aid you and your teams in decision making. [Wikipedia's article on AHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process) does an excellent job explaining it.
* see also this "worked-out example" on Wikipedia: [AHP – car example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process_–_car_example)
* With the help of the [ahp node package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ahp) and [charist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/), we were able to make this AHP visualization tool a reality.
